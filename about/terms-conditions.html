<p>(iii) T3SV Loyalty hereby grants to you a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable license to access and use T3SV Loyalty’s hosted Merchant Web Portal (the “Portal”) for internal business purposes so long as your account with T3SV Loyalty remains current and active. If T3SV Loyalty provides you with a password to access the Portal, you are solely responsible for protecting the password and for any authorized or unauthorized use made of the password.

<p>(iv) Without limiting any of T3SV Loyalty’s rights set forth in the Agreement, T3SV Loyalty reserves the right, in its sole discretion but without any obligation on its part, to reject, remove, delete and/or cancel any information or content displayed or posted on any tablet, the T3SV Loyalty website, any portion of the T3SV Loyalty Program, and/or within any print materials, including without limitation any information and/or content that, in T3SV Loyalty’s view, contains content or links which do not meet T3SV Loyalty’s specifications or requirements. In addition, T3SV Loyalty shall be entitled, in its sole discretion and without notice to any party, to redesign and/or modify all or any portion of the T3SV Loyalty Program (including without limitation any mobile application and/or software) at any time.</p>

<h2 id="4-fees-pricing-and-payment-terms-taxes">4. Fees; Pricing and Payment Terms; Taxes.</h2>
<p>(i) T3SV Loyalty’s current fees for the T3SV Loyalty Programs and its services are set forth in the Merchant Agreement.

<p>(ii) When you provide your payment information to T3SV Loyalty, you are providing T3SV Loyalty with an authorization to process any and all payments as outlined in this Agreement. In certain instances, the payment processing may not occur immediately, and your payment may show as “pending” during this time period. In addition, T3SV Loyalty may request an authorization for the amount of your anticipated transaction in advance and may estimate the final value of the transaction, which may be more than the amount of the actual transaction. T3SV Loyalty will release any funds authorized in excess of the amount of the actual transaction at the time the transaction settles.</p>

<p>(iii) You will be responsible for any sales, use, value-added or import taxes, customs duties or similar taxes assessed in accordance with applicable law with respect to the provision of the T3SV Loyalty Programs.</p>

<p>(iv) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, T3SV Loyalty, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate the Agreement and corresponding access and right to use all or any portion of the T3SV Loyalty Programs, at any time, upon electronic or other notice to you, if you have not paid all amounts due on or before the payment due date, or for any other breaches of the Merchant Agreement, these Terms and Conditions, or any other exhibits, addenda or attachments to these Terms and Conditions including any links contained in the Merchant Agreement or these Terms and Conditions, which are incorporated by reference herein. You are responsible for amounts that remain outstanding as of the date of such termination including early cancellation fees.

<p>(v) T3SV Loyalty will repair or replace damaged tablets due to normal wear and year or any hardware/software malfunction at no cost to any merchant in good standing. A merchant in good standing is primarily defined as having no outstanding balance due to T3SV Loyalty, but may be defined by other criteria as specified by T3SV Loyalty.</p>

<p>(vi) Should your Merchant Agreement indicate a seasonal term, your contract will be extended by the number of months which billing is paused for seasonality, as indicated on the Agreement. All T3SV Loyalty equipment will remain the responsibility of the merchant during entire term of the Agreement.</p>

<h2 id="5-term-termination-survival">5. Term; Termination; Survival.</h2>
<p>The T3SV Loyalty solution term, as further described below, is effective upon the earlier of the arrival date or estimated arrival date of the solution as stated within the Merchant Agreement. All other subsequent changes or modifications to the merchant agreement are effective upon the completion of the merchant purchase order. You may amend your contract to include additional T3SV Loyalty features through your Web Command Center. When you make changes through your Web Command Center, you are providing explicit authorization for T3SV Loyalty to process payment on your existing T3SV Loyalty account and method of payment without any further authorization necessary from you.</p>

<p>The Agreement will remain in full force specified in the Merchant Agreement. At the end of any Subscription Plan, unless you select a new Subscription Plan, your Subscription Plan will automatically renew on a month–to–month Subscription Plan at the then-current rates. Effective January 1, 2015, new agreements and/or subscriptions may automatically renew for successive 1-year terms upon expiration of the initial term of any Subscription Plan at the then-current standard rates until such time as either party provides written notice of termination to the other party, in accordance with terms below. Current fees will be charged to the payment method on file unless T3SV Loyalty is otherwise notified of a cancellation in writing. Although T3SV Loyalty may choose to send a reminder email prior to charging a customer for a renewal fee, T3SV Loyalty is not responsible for notifying a customer of this automated renewal.</p>

<p>A merchant may cancel its subscription, thereby terminating this Agreement, solely in accordance with the following cancellation policies:</p>

<p>Money Back Guarantee – If your Merchant Agreement specifies that you are entitled to a “30 day Money Back Guarantee” you shall, by providing written termination notice to T3SV Loyalty within thirty (30) days of the Installation Date, be entitled to have the T3SV Loyalty Kit uninstalled. In order to qualify for your Money–Back–Guarantee, we simply require that you speak to your Merchant Success Manager to set up your program and enroll a minimum of 5 customers during the Money–Back–Guarantee period. If you do not meet these qualifications you will be charged a restocking fee of $50 upon cancellation. Within thirty (30) days of T3SV Loyalty’s receipt of the T3SV Loyalty Kit, T3SV Loyalty will refund you any money collected for the initial monthly subscription fee in the same manner in which the initial fee was paid. All Onboarding, Activation, or Setup fees are non-refundable. If, after thirty (30) days from the Installation Date and prior to the subsequent Subscription Period, you desire to terminate the T3SV Loyalty Program, you agree to pay an early cancellation fee equal to six (6) months of your monthly subscription fee, as well as a $50 restocking fee via the credit card or ACH on file with T3SV Loyalty. If you subscribe to a variable subscription fee plan, your early cancellation fee is equal to (6) months at the most recent monthly billed rate along with a $50 restocking fee.</p>

<p>Renewal – At the end of any Subscription Plan, unless you select a new Subscription plan, your Subscription Plan will automatically be renewed on an annual or monthly (as applicable) basis at the then-current standard rates. Current fees will be charged to the credit card or ACH on file unless T3SV Loyalty is otherwise notified of a cancellation in writing. Customers renewed on a monthly basis must provide written cancellation notice at least sixty (60) days prior to the beginning of the next monthly or annual term (as applicable). Customers renewed on an annual basis must provide written cancellation notice sixty (60) days prior to or within the first thirty (30) days of their renewal period. Although T3SV Loyalty may choose to send a reminder email prior to charging a customer for a renewal fee, T3SV Loyalty is not responsible for notifying a customer of this automated renewal.</p>

<p>Subscription Cancellation within the Contract Term – Customers enrolled in Monthly or Annual subscription plans shall provide at least sixty (60) days’ written cancellation notice. If, prior to the subsequent Subscription Period, you desire to terminate the T3SV Loyalty Program, You agree to pay an early cancellation fee equal to six (6) months of your monthly subscription fee, as well as a $50 restocking fee via the credit card or ACH on file with T3SV Loyalty. If you subscribe to a variable subscription fee plan, your early cancellation fee is equal to six (6) months at the most recent monthly billed rate along with a $50 restocking fee. You will not be entitled to any refund of any pre-paid or prior subscription payments.</p>

<p>Other Events – Each party shall have the right to terminate the Agreement upon written notice to the other party: (i) upon the institution of insolvency, receivership or bankruptcy proceedings or any other proceedings for the settlement of debts of the other party that is not otherwise dismissed within sixty (60) days of such institution; (ii) upon the making of an assignment for the benefit of creditors by the other party; or (iii) upon the dissolution of the other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, T3SV Loyalty may terminate the Agreement and/or your access to one or all T3SV Loyalty Programs in the event you fail to remain current in all fees due and owing to T3SV Loyalty or in the event you breach any of your obligations under the Agreement. T3SV Loyalty will cease to collect the monthly subscription fee at the point in time in which T3SV Loyalty has received your returned T3SV Loyalty Kit.</p>

<p>In the event of any termination of the Agreement or any T3SV Loyalty Program, T3SV Loyalty shall be entitled to send e-mail and/or other communications to some or all of your loyalty program members, notifying each such member of your termination of the T3SV Loyalty Program. In addition to the foregoing permissible e-mail, T3SV Loyalty shall be entitled to take other actions, at its discretion, to assist your loyalty program members in protecting the points earned within the T3SV Loyalty Program and providing them an opportunity to redeem points earned.</p>

<p>In addition, all items in the T3SV Loyalty Kit must be returned to T3SV Loyalty in specified return packaging provided by T3SV Loyalty. If you were not previously provided with specified return packaging, T3SV Loyalty will provide you with specified return packaging at no cost to you, otherwise you will be charged for packaging materials. You are responsible for all return shipping charges and for any damage incurred in the shipping process. If any item in the T3SV Loyalty Kit is not returned, T3SV Loyalty will charge you for the cost of the item not returned. T3SV Loyalty will prorate the last monthly subscription fee based on the date the T3SV Loyalty Kit is received by T3SV Loyalty. You may be required to fill out an exit survey in order to complete any cancellation request. T3SV Loyalty may refuse to accept the return of its equipment until the exit survey is completed. If You do not complete the exit survey in a timely fashion, You may be charged a fee for missing equipment until the exit survey is completed. Any provision of the Agreement which contemplates performance or observance subsequent to any termination or expiration of the Agreement shall survive any termination or expiration of the Agreement and continue in full force and effect. Upon expiration or termination of this agreement all items in the T3SV Loyalty Kit must be returned to T3SV Loyalty within 14 days. If the tablet is lost or not returned within 14 days, you will be charged a penalty fee to cover the tablet equipment costs as well as a non–refundable late fee.</p>

<h2 id="7-confidential-information">7. Confidential Information.</h2>
